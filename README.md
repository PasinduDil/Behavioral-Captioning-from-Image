Abstract
This project implements an advanced behavioral captioning system that transforms visual scenes into nuanced behavioral narratives. Unlike traditional image captioning that focuses on object identification and scene description, this system employs multi-modal AI to infer psychological states, social dynamics, and behavioral intentions from visual information

Key Features
•	Multi-model image captioning (BLIP + ViT-GPT2) 
•	Advanced behavioral inference using Large Language Models 
•	Comprehensive prompt template library 
•	Configurable analysis depth (Basic, Detailed, Academic) 
•	Batch processing capabilities 
•	Google Drive integration 
•	Professional documentation and error handling
